Making changes to the container and also manipulating the containers.

The above tutorials will say how to run and work with the containers but here we will focus on building the container.

=docker- machine active=

You can see the machine you have created by running the docker-machine ls command again with =docker-machine ls=

thus now you have pulled an ubuntu image and now run it using the command

=docker run -it [contianer-id] /bin/bash=

will give you the cmd of the cotainer image

thus run the two below commands

=apt-get update=

                   and
                   
=apt-get install npm= this is to install the node package on to the image.

Docker file is basically not changed here but the inage gets changed without changing the Dockerfile.

then exit the cotainer with the =exit= command.

Now whne you do =docker ps= you will not find the comtainer running as you have came out of the container.

also you can check with the command =docker container ls=

thus will not show the ubuntu container running.

this is the step where you have to type =docker commit [container-id-from-docekr-images] [use-your-desired-tag]

Then the contianer after execution will get a hash and you will start running the contianer from there with the new contianer-id as you ran the other containers.
